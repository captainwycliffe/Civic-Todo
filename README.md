# To-Do List API

This is a simple **To-Do List API** built using **Node.js** and **SQLite**.

## Features:
- Create a new to-do
- Retrieve all to-dos
- Retrieve a single to-do by ID
- Update an existing to-do
- Delete a to-do

## Requirements:
- **Node.js** (v16 or later)
- **npm** (v8 or later)
- **SQLite** (local database)

## Setup Instructions:

### 1. Clone the Repository:
First, clone the repository to your local machine.

```bash
git clone https://github.com/yourusername/todo-api.git
```

Navigate to the project directory:

```bash
cd todo-api
```

### 2. Install Dependencies:
Install the necessary dependencies using `npm`.

```bash
npm install
```

### 4. Start the Server:
You can start the server by running the following command:

```bash
node server.js
```

This will start the API on the specified port (default is 5000).

If you want to use `nodemon` to automatically restart the server on file changes, use the following command:

```bash
npx nodemon server.js
```

### 5. Test the API:
Once the server is running, you can test the following API endpoints using Postman or cURL:

#### **GET** `/api/todos`
- Fetch all todos.

#### **GET** `/api/todos/:id`
- Fetch a specific todo by ID.

#### **POST** `/api/todos`
- Create a new todo.
- Request body should include:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "New Todo",
    "completed": false
  }
  ```

#### **PUT** `/api/todos/:id`
- Update an existing todo.
- Request body should include:
  ```json
  {
    "title": "Updated Todo",
    "completed": true
  }
  ```

#### **DELETE** `/api/todos/:id`
- Delete a todo by ID.

### 6. Database Setup:
If this is the first time running the server, it will automatically create a SQLite database (`todos.db`). The database stores all to-do items.

### 7. Available Scripts:
- **`npm start`**: Start the server using Node.js.
- **`npx nodemon server.js`**: Start the server with `nodemon` for auto-reloading on changes.
- **`npm install`**: Install the required dependencies.

---

## Troubleshooting:

1. **If you see the error `Cannot open database file`**, ensure that the path to the SQLite database file (`todos.db`) is correct and that the file has appropriate permissions.

2. **If the server is not starting**, ensure that you have Node.js installed correctly by running `node -v` and `npm -v` to check the versions.

---

By following these steps, you should be able to run and test your To-Do List API server locally.
